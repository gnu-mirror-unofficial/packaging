<h3>A <b>VERY</b> Brief History:</h3>
<p>
Since 1984 it has been the intention of the GNU Project to develop
an entire GNU system based exclusively on Free Software. Up to around
1990 an entire series of GNU software came to existence, including
The GNU Compiler Collection (gcc), Emacs, The GNU Debugger (gdb), and much more.
</p>
<p>
The following quote taken from <a href=http://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html>
http://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html</a>:

<blockquote><p>
<b>"The GNU Hurd</b><br>
<br>
By 1990, the GNU system was almost complete; the only major missing component was the kernel. We had decided to implement our kernel as a collection of server processes running on top of Mach. Mach is a microkernel developed at Carnegie Mellon University and then at the University of Utah; the GNU HURD is a collection of servers (or ``herd of gnus'') that run on top of Mach, and do the various jobs of the Unix kernel. The start of development was delayed as we waited for Mach to be released as free software, as had been promised.
<br>
<br>
One reason for choosing this design was to avoid what seemed to be the hardest part of the job: debugging a kernel program without a source-level debugger to do it with. This part of the job had been done already, in Mach, and we expected to debug the HURD servers as user programs, with GDB. But it took a long time to make that possible, and the multi-threaded servers that send messages to each other have turned out to be very hard to debug. Making the HURD work solidly has stretched on for many years."</p></blockquote>

<h3>So where are we now?</h3>
<p>
While continuing to be a virtual unknown outside of the Free Software world,
 work has continued on The GNU System. A small team of dedicated developers
have continued to prove the viability of a micro-kernel based system. Although
 we do not have the plethora of packages enjoyed by a GNU/Linux or BSD we
 have overcome many obsticles and have started this new project to begin 
the push for a releasable GNU System encompassing the GNUMach microkernel, 
the HURD servers, GNU libc (glibc), GNU userland applications, and other
Free Software packages.
