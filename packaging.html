<H3>A <B>VERY</B> Brief History:</H3>
<P>
Since 1984 it has been the intention of the GNU Project to develop an
entire GNU system based exclusively on Free Software.  Up to around
1990 an entire series of GNU software came to existence, including the
GNU Compiler Collection (gcc), Emacs, the GNU Debugger (gdb), and much
more.
</P>

<B>The GNU Hurd</B><BR>
<BR>
By 1990, the GNU system was almost complete; the only major missing
component was the kernel.  We had decided to implement our kernel as a
collection of server processes running on top of Mach.  Mach is a
microkernel developed at Carnegie Mellon University and then at the
University of Utah; the GNU HURD is a collection of servers (or ``herd
of gnus'') that run on top of Mach, and do the various jobs of the
Unix kernel.  The start of development was delayed as we waited for
Mach to be released as free software, as had been promised.
<BR>
<BR>
One reason for choosing this design was to avoid what seemed to be the
hardest part of the job: debugging a kernel program without a
source-level debugger to do it with.  This part of the job had been
done already, in Mach, and we expected to debug the HURD servers as
user programs, with GDB.  But it took a long time to make that
possible, and the multi-threaded servers that send messages to each
other have turned out to be very hard to debug.  Making the HURD work
solidly has stretched on for many years.

<H3>So where are we now?</H3>
<P>
While continuing to be virtual unknown outside of the Free Software
world, work has continued on the GNU System.  A small team of both
skilled and dedicated developers have continued to prove the viability
of a micro-kernel based system.  Although we do not have the plethora
of packages enjoyed by GNU/Linux or BSD systems we have overcome many
important obstacles. Hence we have started this new project to begin
the push for a releasable GNU System encompassing the GNU Mach
microkernel, the Hurd servers, GNU C Library (glibc), GNU userland
applications, and other Free Software packages.
</P>

<H3>What is currently being focused on?</H3>
<P>
A GNU system creator is being developed alongside a filesystem which
transparently manages these native packages. Such a filesystem is
possible courtesy of the flexible design of the Hurd itself, and will
ease the use of a truly advanced package system greatly. Furthermore a
number of people are working on updating programs to work with all the
features that the GNU system provides.
</P>

<P>
Though still in the planning phase, an installer is also being developed.
The installer will run from a LiveCD, which itself will be running GNU, and
will feature an easy to use GUI interface.
